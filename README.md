# **Click The Apps Game**

## **Deployed Link:**

- https://neelyanne.github.io/clicky/

## **Overview:**

The Click App is a web game application where users click images of commonly known apps in order to earn points. You win the game whenever you have clicked all 12 of the different apps. The only catch is that the apps switch locations with every click...

## **Technologies Used:**

React.js- UI
Bootstrap- CSS framework

## **About the Code:**

Getting Started

- First thing I did was create the React Client-side boilerplate by typing create-react-app Clicky-game in the command line. Next, I changed into that directory by typing 'cd Clicky-game' in the terminal. After that I typed npm start to open the app in the browser.

Starting to Code

- Create-react-app gives you a public folder with a basic index.html page, some basic css for the react template, an App.js file, index.js file, and some other boilerplate files. I only had to alter two things in the index.html page: the title of my app and include a Bootstrap CDN link. I either altered or completely changed the rest of the files, adding my own style. The bulk of the code for this app was done in the src/components directory. I decided to make three total components for my app, however, it could have been made with much more or probably less.

## **Components:**

- Page

  - To adjust the way the cards are displayed on the final page.

- Character

  - The app images that go into each card.

- Jumbotron
  - The header component to the whole page with the score and hgame explanation.
